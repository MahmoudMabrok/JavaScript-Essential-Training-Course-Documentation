## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a **scripting** language that allows writing small programs that run on the browser and changes the content(HTML and CSS) of the current document.

#### What does Scripting mean?
A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports **scripts**(Programs written for a specific runtime environment to automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator).

- A scripting language is interpreted rather than compiled.

#### Any web page is a combined output of three layers of code:
1. HTML document:  
where the content itself lives. 
2. CSS rules:  
guides the browser on how to display the content(presentation layer).  
    * This provides a perfect **separation of concerns**: the html holds the content while the css holds its presentation.
3. JavaScript:  
Logic code that interacts with the HTML as well as the CSS to make the web page much more interactive(interactive layer).

## How is JavaScript related to Java?
Actually JavaScript and Java are totally different things. The thing that they share in common is that they are programming languages. **Java is to JavaScript** what **Car is to Carpet**.

## Navigating the JavaScript landscape
* ECMAScript is a standard that JavaScript conforms to.
* ES6 is ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015.
* Browser use ECMAScript to interpret JavaScript.
* If the browser does not support ES6 and your code is ES6, you need a **transpiler** like Babel to translate ES6 to old JavaScript.
* JavaScript has server-side tools like **Node.js** which enables JavaScript to act as a server-side language.
* JavaScript has libraries like **JQuery** and frameworks such as **React** and **AngularJS**.
    * A library is a collection of classes containing useful methods that **you** call to avoid building from scratch.
    * A framework is a skeleton that defines the architecture of an application and **it** calls your code to define certain things in the application.
* React and AngularJS are frameworks used to facilitate building interactive web applications.
* While traditional technologies like PHP generate the website pages on the server and sends them to the browser, these frameworks run on the browser and pull just the data from the server. This makes the website that run them super fast.
