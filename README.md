# JavaScript Essential Training Course Documentation

## Course Overview
* This course gives you a breif introduction to JavaScript. JavaScript has become a very useful tool in many disciplines of software
development especially web and mobile applications. Through this course you will learn how to write scripts that make the web much
more interactive, how to debug on the browser, and how to use some tools for validation and troubleshooting. You will also build
three mini projects to get hands on JavaScript.
* In my opinion one should have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS before starting this course.
* Unfortunately, the course does not have a final project but there are quiz following each chapter.
* Instructor: Marten Rand-Hendriksen.
